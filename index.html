    If i will be given the ability and the chance to invent something, 
    i will make sure to invent something that will be benefitial in the long run.
     Something that will be able to help the old and the young. Although i still have no idea on what to focus on,
     i will most likely invent a security device which has an automatic retinal scanner or a voice scanner which will determine the user's
     identity over one simple action.
